# Binarish
Binarish is names given to the positions in the binary number system. Just like in English we say one hundred and five instead of one zero five. One difference the binary system have to base ten is that we can have a one at the position or not, in Binarish this is represented as including and excluding the name associated with the position.

## Position names
Position | Worth | Name
-------- | ----- | ----
1 | 1 | ki
2 | 2 | mo
3 | 4 | di
4 | 8 | so
5 | 16 | fi
6 | 32 | no
7 | 64 | li
8 | 128 | po

Note that every other power of two ends with either 'i' or 'o'.
Zero is just zero and negative numbers are prefixed with neg.

## Example numbers:
Base 10 | Binary representation | Binarish | English
------- | --------------------- | -------- | -------
1 | 1 | ki | one
2 | 10 | mo | two
3 | 11 | moki | tree
4 | 100 | di | four
5 | 101 | diki | five
6 | 110 | dimo | six
-10 | -1010 | negsomo | negative ten
0 | 0 | zero | zero
100 | 1100100 | linodi | one hundred

Note that just like in English the most significant name is pronounced first.

## Example usage
Some arithmetics gets easier
```
4 + 3 = 7
so + moki = somoki
```

```
105 - 40 = 65
linosoki - noso = liki
```

```
7 + 1 = 8
dimoki + ki = so
```

```
10 / 2 = 5
somo / mo = moki
```
